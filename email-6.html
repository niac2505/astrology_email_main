            <p>That’s an illusory correlation.</p>
            <p>Many studies have shown that if you read a horoscope that you think is yours but has actually been randomly assigned to you, you’ll probably still think it resonates. That’s especially true if you’re into astrology: believers are significantly more likely than skeptics to buy into bogus horoscopes.</p>
            <p>That’s the Barnum Effect (also known as the Forer Effect). Astrologers write horoscopes to be just specific enough that they feel personal, while still being vague enough to be open to interpretation. Fortune tellers and mediums use a similar trick. So do Myers-Briggs assessments (and yes, it’s past time to abandon the MBTI too).</p>
            <p>Hearing that you share a sign is a form of social glue. In one experiment, people were nearly twice as likely to help a stranger if they had been randomly assigned to learn that they shared a birthday. (Plot twist: they didn’t.) It’s easier to bond with people when you expect to get along with them.</p>

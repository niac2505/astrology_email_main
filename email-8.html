            <p>That’s an illusory correlation.I’m glad you asked. Of all the factors that shape our personalities, the most influential one is DNA. 
                <br><br>
                Twin studies consistently show that the major traits are about 50% heritable. Many genetic variants combine to shape your tendencies, and environmental factors like parenting, peers, and trauma affect how those tendencies are expressed. If you want to understand your personality better, look to your genes and experiences, not to the sky. There’s no plausible pathway through which star alignment upon womb exit can alter your brain or your life.
                <br><br>
                Astrology doesn’t predict life outcomes either. In a nationally representative sample of over 30,000 Americans, happiness levels didn’t differ meaningfully by sign. Neither did infidelity or divorce rates, which were between 21% and 22% for all 12 signs.</p>

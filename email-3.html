            <p>Capricorn,</p>
            <p>Knowing someone’s zodiac sign reveals nothing about their personality.</p>
            <p>Astrologers claim that zodiac signs are important factors in personality. Pisces is loving. Sagittarius is free-spirited. Taurus is loyal (and freaky, according to the renowned stargazer Beyoncé).
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p> <em>These are hypotheses. How would you test them scientifically?</em><br></p>
            <figcaption>
                You could start by surveying a group of people about their birthdays and personalities to see how they cluster together.
                <br><br>
                That’s what a team led by MIT professor Jackson Lu did. They recruited a massive sample—173,709 people. They correlated their zodiac signs with their scores on the Big Five personality traits. And they found zero correspondence.
                <br><br>
                That’s right… none. 
                <br><br>
                Let’s start with agreeableness. On a 1-7 scale, how friendly, cooperative, and polite are you?
                <br><br>
                If you think Libras are peace-loving, you might expect them to score in the 6 range on agreeableness. If you see Scorpios as argumentative, you’d put them around 2.
                You’d be mistaken. Scorpios averaged a 5.61 on agreeableness. Libras came in at 5.63. The scores for the other ten signs were all between 5.61 and 5.63 too. Every sign was equally agreeable.
                <br><br>
                The same was true for the other traits—conscientiousness, emotional stability, extraversion, and openness. On every trait measured, average scores failed to vary statistically by sign.

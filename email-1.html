            <p>Dear Capricorn,</p>
            <p>It brings me no <a href="#">joy</a> to do this..</p>
            <p>I'm not just worried about you, Capricorn. I'm concerned for everyone out there with a celestial tattoo. Astrology is a $12 billion industry, and it’s gaining popularity with younger generations. I was shocked to learn that four in ten Americans don't know that astrology is not at all scientific.</p>
            <p>I know what you're thinking. That's exactly what a Scorpio would say!</p>
            <p>Nice try, but I'm an Aries. Which is meaningless… but not harmless.</p>
            <p>On a first date, you crave a quick fix of what's your sign? When you get a job offer, you’re lost until you check your horoscope for guidance from Io and Europa. When a friend says you're too <a href="#">emotional</a>, you blame it on the fact that your mom was induced three weeks before your due date.</p>
            <p>But Capricorn, I can't stay silent any longer.</p>
            <p>This is an intervention.</p>

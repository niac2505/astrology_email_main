            <p>There’s some evidence that astrology often appeals to people who lack critical thinking skills and want to feel special. I know that’s not you. I think it helps you manage uncertainty. Religion used to play that role for more people, and Marx called it “the opiate of the masses.” The difference is that religion can’t be falsified (scientists can’t disprove the existence of a deity or an afterlife), but astrology has been.</p>
            <p>If you stop and think about it, the whole idea of astrology is arbitrary. How could the position of the sun, moon, and planets on the day you happened to be born possibly have a permanent effect on your personality?</p>
            <p>I’m not biased against horoscopes—I’m partial to strong evidence. If you have better data, I’m ready to think again. In the meantime, I hope you’ll listen with an open mind.</p>

            <p>It’s time to kick your astrology habit.</p>
            <p>You’re hurting yourself by forming impressions of people based on irrelevant information. And you’re hurting others by holding prejudice against them for something that has nothing to do with who they are. You wouldn’t judge people by their fingerprint type or their blood type, and you shouldn’t judge them by their zodiac sign either.

                In China, it’s common for people to display their zodiac signs on their resumes and dating profiles. In experiments, simply labeling a candidate as a Virgo rather than a Libra is enough to reduce their odds of getting a job and finding love. Managers don’t want to hire them—and people don’t want to date them.
                <br><br>
                Even parents are biased against their own children based on zodiac signs. When Chinese kids are born just outside the cutoff of a “lucky” sign, their parents tend to invest less in their education—which leaves them worse off on math and verbal tests.

            <figcaption>
                There’s some evidence that astrology often appeals to people who lack critical thinking skills and want to feel special. I know that’s not you. I think it helps you manage uncertainty. Religion used to play that role for more people, and Marx called it “the opiate of the masses.” The difference is that religion can’t be falsified (scientists can’t disprove the existence of a deity or an afterlife), but astrology has been.
                <br><br>
                Even if you’re just microdosing for fun, there are risks. Astrology may be a gateway drug: it can open the door to the hard stuff. Research suggests that people who believe in astrology are also more likely to think the Holocaust didn’t happen, the earth isn’t spherical, and 9/11 was planned by the U.S. government. If you’re drawn to one flawed idea, what’s to stop you from embracing others? One day you’re entertaining nonsense about the moon, the next you’re convinced that the moon landing was faked.

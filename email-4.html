            <p>You’re right.</p>
            <p>Birthdays do matter, but it’s not because there’s a connection between zodiac sign and personality. The advantage comes from relative age. When you’re young, being a few months older than your peers makes a big difference. In elementary school, January kids have more mature bodies and brains than July kids. They seem stronger and faster to their coaches—and smarter and more responsible to their teachers—so they get more encouragement and more opportunity. Over time, they develop a cumulative advantage.</p>
